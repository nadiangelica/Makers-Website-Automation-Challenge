# Makers-Website-Automation-Challenge
Challenge
This is a process feedback challenge. That means you should record yourself doing it and submit that recording to your coach for feedback. How do I do this?

You are part of the quality engineering team at Makers. You have been asked to create a simple end-to-end test for the Makers website, to check that some of the site's key features are working correctly.

You'll need to practice everything that you've learned in the past three challenges, to locate elements on the page and perform actions/assertions against them.

Record yourself writing a Selenium test to accomplish the following:

Create a new Java class, and configure your initial JUnit/Selenium code.
Instruct Selenium to browse to https://makers.tech.
Assert that the page title includes the text "Building The Future".
Assert that the page has a link which contains the text "Code of Conduct".
Assert that if you click the "Code of Conduct" link, you are taken to the page https://makers.tech/code-of-conduct/ and that the page title includes the text "Code of conduct".
Browse back to the homepage.
Assert that if you click the "FAQs" link, you are taken to the FAQs page.
On the FAQs page, enter "badger" in the search box, and confirm that the results page contains the text No results for "badger".
